      "In this electrifying WWE arena, Cody Rhodes, the Undisputed WWE Champion, made his first appearance since the shocking betrayal at WWE Elimination Chamber. The crowd was buzzing with anticipation as Cody entered the ring, his bruised and battered face a stark reminder of the betrayal by John Cena. Reflecting on the moment his daughter asked about his injury, Cody confessed that he had run into a wall built by The Rock, Travis Scott, and John Cena. He expressed his disappointment in Cena, someone he once idolized, and questioned why he had turned his back on their shared history. Despite the betrayal, Cody acknowledged the support of his fans and the bittersweet feeling of sharing his championship victory with an adversary. He declared himself the American Nightmare and vowed to be ready for any challenge that came his way. Cody was determined to fight for the truth, his legacy, and the future he envisioned for his daughter, breaking down the walls that surrounded him with every match.\n"

As he climbed the steps, the audience erupted in a mix of cheers and murmurs, all eyes drawn to the bruised and battered visage of their champion.Cody's left eye was swollen, a stark reminder of the chaos that had unfolded just days prior when John Cena, a man he once idolized, turned heel and attacked him.The sight of his father’s legacy being tarnished by a betrayal he never saw coming weighed heavily on him. Cody grabbed the microphone, his voice steady but laced with emotion.He began by reflecting on the moment his daughter had innocently asked him about the injury.“I told her I ran into a wall,” he confessed, allowing a brief, bittersweet smile to cross his lips.“But that wasn’t entirely a lie.I ran into a wall built by The Rock, Travis Scott, and John Cena.”  There was a palpable shift in the atmosphere as Cody continued, reminiscing about the days when he and Cena shared the road, a time when Cena was nothing short of a hero in his eyes.“I used to look up to him,” he admitted, his voice thick with nostalgia.“But now, I find myself standing here, asking why he did it.What drove him to betray me? To turn his back on everything we built together?”  The crowd began to respond, some chanting Cena's name while others shouted support for Cody.He took a moment to absorb it all, the duality of admiration and betrayal swirling around him.“John will likely justify his actions,” Cody pressed on, “but there’s no justification for what he did.A great man gave up, and it’s a tragedy.”  As he spoke, Cody shifted his focus to the support of the fans who had rallied behind him during his title run at WrestleMania 40.He recalled the moment of victory, the elation that came with the championship, and the bittersweet feeling of sharing it with a man who now stood as an adversary.“John celebrated with me that night,” he reminded the audience, “but he also told me that the title gets heavier every day.I guess he wasn’t strong enough to carry it anymore.”  With fire igniting in his eyes, Cody concluded his message.“John Cena may be the last of his kind, but I am not.I’m the American Nightmare, and if he wants a piece of me, he knows where to find me.I’ll be waiting.”  The crowd erupted, a mixture of cheers and applause, as Cody dropped the microphone and stood tall, the champion in the face of adversity.He had laid bare his heart, revealing his vulnerability and strength in one powerful moment.The road ahead was uncertain, but Cody Rhodes was ready to face whatever came next—because in the world of wrestling, the only certainty was the fight.And he was prepared to fight for the truth, for his legacy, and for the future he envisioned for his daughter.The walls may have been built around him, but he was determined to break them down, one match at a time.\"}\n",
